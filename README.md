Functionalities
1. List Movies
View a list of movies stored in the database.
2. Add Movie
Add new movies to the database using data retrieved from an external movie API.
3. Delete Movie
Remove movies from the database.
4. Update Movie
Update the rating of existing movies in the database.
5. Display Movie Statistics
View various statistics related to the movies in the database, such as average rating, median rating, best movie, and worst movie.
6. Get a Random Movie
Get a randomly selected movie from the database.
7. Search Movie
Search for a movie in the database.
8. Sort Movies by Rating
Sort the movies in the database based on their ratings.
9. Generate Website
Generate a website based on the movie data stored in the database.

Learned how to make HTTP requests using the requests library and process JSON responses.
4. File I/O Operations
Implemented functionalities to read from and write to CSV and JSON files for storing movie data.
Gained experience in working with file objects, reading and writing data, and managing file paths.
5. Data Handling and Processing
Processed and manipulated movie data stored in CSV and JSON formats.
Performed operations such as filtering, sorting, and calculating statistics on movie data.
6. Documentation
Wrote comprehensive docstrings for classes and methods to document their purpose, parameters, and return values.
Learned the importance of clear and concise documentation for code readability and maintainability.
7. Version Control with Git
Utilized Git for version control, managing project files, and collaborating with team members.
Practiced common Git commands for committing changes, branching, merging, and resolving conflicts.

# Conclusion
The Movie App project provided an excellent opportunity to enhance Python programming skills, deepen understanding of OOP concepts, and gain hands-on experience with data handling, external API integration, and documentation practices. By working on this project, valuable insights were gained into building robust, scalable, and maintainable software applications.
